# Pentathlon-Next-Product-to-Buy-Modeling

## Project Description
This project aimed at forecasting the next purchase of Pentathlon customers using advanced machine learning techniques. Various models, including logistic regression, neural networks, random forests, and XGBoost, were employed. Each model was fine-tuned with specific hyperparameters to enhance predictive accuracy. The objective was to analyze customer behavioral data and predict buying probabilities in response to different promotional messages, thereby determining the most effective marketing strategies for each customer.

## Technology Stack
- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, pyrsm
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Methodology and Key Accomplishments

### Data Preparation and Analysis
- **Data Segmentation**: Divided data into training and testing sets for robust model validation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilized pandas for in-depth analysis of customer demographics and behavioral patterns.

### Model Development and Evaluation
